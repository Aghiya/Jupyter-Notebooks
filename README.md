# Machine Learning Project
This repository contains different machine learning models attempting classify two different datasets done with two different machine learning libraries: Spark MLlib and Sci-kit Learn. 

# Algorithm Libraries

## Spark Mllib models
Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Gradient-boosted Tree, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

## Sci-kit Learn models
Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Linear Support Vector Machine, and Multilayer Perceptron.

# Datasets Information

## Telco dataset
This dataset provides information on customers who left the company's service along with various features like number of dependents, total charges,
monthly charges, etc. It comes from the IBM Watson community, and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

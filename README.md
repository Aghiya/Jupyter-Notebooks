# Machine Learning Project
This repository contains 5 different machine learning models attempting classify two different datasets done with two different machine learning libraries: Spark MLlib and Sci-kit Learn. 

The Spark MLlib models are: Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector Machine, Gradient-boosted Tree, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

The Sci-kit Learn models are: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
